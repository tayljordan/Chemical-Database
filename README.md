# bulk-chemical-compatibility-table

Compatibility data for chemical shipment by water.

The cargo groups in the compatibility table are separated into two categories: 1 through 22 are reactive groups and 30 through 43 are cargo groups. Left unassigned and available for future expansion are groups 23 through 29 and those past 43. reactive groups contain products which are chemically the most reactive; dangerous combinations may result between members of different reactive groups and between members of reactive groups and cargo groups. Products assigned to cargo groups, however, are much less reactive; dangerous combinations involving these can be formed only with members of certain Reactive Groups.
